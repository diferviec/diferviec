Data Analyst | BI & Automation | Public Transport Systems

## About me
I am a Data Analyst specialized in business intelligence, automation, and
operational analytics, with a focus on public transport systems.

My work centers on transforming raw transactional and operational data—such as
ticket validations and access-control events—into structured datasets,
analytical pipelines, and operational dashboards that support monitoring,
decision-making, and process optimization.

## What I work on
- Public transport operational analytics
- Validation processing and trip reconstruction logic
- ETL pipelines for cleaning, normalizing, and aggregating raw data
- KPI definition and monitoring for stations and services
- Dashboarding and visualization for operational decision support
- Analytical foundations for anomaly and fraud detection

## Featured projects

### 🚍 Transport Validation & Trip Reconstruction Analysis
Analytical pipeline for processing anonymized ticket validation data and
reconstructing complete and incomplete trips from time-ordered events.

Focus areas include:
- Validation cleaning and normalization
- ENTRY → EXIT trip reconstruction logic
- Handling incomplete trips and edge cases
- Generation of analysis-ready datasets and reports

### 📊 Public Transport Operations Dashboard (Power BI)
Operational analytics dashboard built with Power BI, designed as the reporting
layer on top of processed validation and trip data.

The dashboard focuses on:
- Travel demand by hour
- Station-to-station passenger flows
- Peak demand analysis
- Monitoring of incomplete or irregular trips

## Tech stack
- **Python** (pandas, numpy)
- **SQL**
- **Power BI** (data modeling, DAX, operational dashboards)
- **Excel** (advanced analysis and automation)

## Notes
All datasets used in public repositories are fully anonymized and intended
exclusively for analytical, educational, and portfolio demonstration purposes.
No real operational or sensitive information is exposed.
